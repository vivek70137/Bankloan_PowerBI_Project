Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data using MS SQL Server for querying and Power BI for data visualization. 
The primary objective of the project is to understand loan performance, customer demographics, and trends, and provide actionable insights through a visual dashboard.

üõ† Project Overview
I started by outlining the business problem, which involved analyzing a dataset containing detailed information about loans, 
such as loan amounts, interest rates, customer demographics, and loan statuses. The goal was to derive insights that could help improve loan decision-making processes.

üìÇ Data Understanding and Preparation
To begin, I imported the raw dataset into MS SQL Server. This step involved creating the necessary databases and tables to store the data. 
I explored the structure of the dataset, gaining familiarity with key fields like loan amounts, funded amounts, interest rates, and borrower information.

Next, I defined important industry-specific terms and created a domain knowledge document to better understand the field of loan analysis. 
This knowledge was crucial for interpreting the data accurately and creating meaningful queries later on.

üìù Data Analysis with SQL
Once the data was loaded into the SQL database, I performed various queries to extract valuable insights:

Total Loan Applications: I wrote a query to calculate the total number of loan applications, giving a high-level view of the demand for loans over time.

Total Funded Amount: I extracted the total amount of loans that were successfully funded, providing insights into the bank's total exposure to loans.

Total Amount Received: This query calculated the total amount received from loan repayments, allowing me to assess the bank's revenue from loans.

Average Interest Rate & Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): These queries calculated the average interest rates and DTI ratios, 
which are key metrics for understanding the overall health of the loan portfolio.

Good vs Bad Loans: I differentiated between successful (good) and defaulted (bad) loans using specific criteria, enabling deeper analysis into loan performance.

Loan Status and Monthly Trends: I also wrote queries to analyze loan statuses (such as current, late, and defaulted loans) and tracked how loan issues fluctuated month-over-month.

Regional Analysis & Loan Term Breakdown: I performed geographic analysis to break down loans by state and examined loans based on term length,
helping identify regional trends and preferences in loan products.

üìä Power BI Dashboard Creation
After querying and cleaning the data, I moved on to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. Here's what I did in Power BI:

Data Modeling: I structured the data model to establish relationships between various tables, ensuring efficient analysis in Power BI. 
This step allowed me to connect data points like loan status, geographic region, and loan terms.

Visualizations: I created various visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, and tables, to present insights from the SQL queries. 
These visualizations made it easier to track metrics like total funded amounts, average interest rates, and loan statuses.

Good vs Bad Loan Breakdown: I created a comparison of good and bad loans, visually representing the proportion of successful vs. defaulted loans.

Loan Status Grid: This grid view provided a comprehensive summary of loan statuses, helping decision-makers see the overall distribution of loans at a glance.

Regional and Loan Term Analysis: I used maps and breakdowns to show how loan metrics vary by state and by loan term (e.g., 36-month vs 60-month loans).
This provided insights into geographic loan performance and preferences.

Home Ownership & Loan Purpose Analysis: I explored the relationship between home ownership and loan performance,
as well as different loan purposes such as debt consolidation or home improvement.

üé® Dashboard Design and Enhancements
In addition to data visualizations, I designed a clean and intuitive dashboard interface:

Background Design: I customized the background of the dashboard to make it visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Slicers and Filters: I added slicers to allow users to filter data by various categories such as state, loan term, and loan purpose. T
hese interactive elements made the dashboard more dynamic and user-friendly.

Trend Analysis: I included a monthly trend view to observe how loan applications and funded amounts have changed over time, 
valuable insights into seasonal or economic factors affecting loan demand.

üîß Advanced Techniques
To further enhance the dashboard‚Äôs functionality, I employed more advanced Power BI techniques:

Field Parameters: I implemented field parameters to allow dynamic switching between different metrics and dimensions within visualizations, adding flexibility to the dashboard.

Filter Interactions: By configuring the interactions between different filters and visuals, I ensured that users could drill down into the data for a more granular analysis.

Navigators: I added navigators to make it easier to switch between different sections of the dashboard, ensuring a smooth user experience.

üèÅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively use MS SQL Server for data querying and Power BI for data visualization.
The analysis provides valuable insights into loan performance, customer demographics, and trends, helping
financial institutions make data-driven decisions. By combining SQL with Power BI, I was able to create a powerful 
tool for loan analysis, offering both in-depth analysis and user-friendly visualizations.
